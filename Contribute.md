# Contributor Guide

Welcome to the MEGAlib contributor guide! We're excited to have you interested in contributing to our project. This guide will help you get started, understand our workflow, and know what to expect when contributing.
How to Contribute

We use a fork and pull request workflow for contributions. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

## Fork the Repository
Go to our GitHub repository and click the "Fork" button at the top right corner of the page. This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

## Clone Your Fork

Clone your fork to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/zoglauer/MEGAlib.git
cd MEGAlib
```

## Create a Branch
Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix. Use a descriptive name for your branch:

```
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

## Make Your Changes
Make your changes in your local repository. Be sure to follow the same coding standards as in the rest of MEGAlib.

## Commit Your Changes
Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature: your feature name"
```

## Push to Your Fork
Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub:

```
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## Open a Pull Request
Go to your forked repository on GitHub and click the "New pull request" button. Select the branch you created and make sure the base repository is set to the original repository. Provide a clear and descriptive title and description for your pull request.

## Respond to Feedback
Your pull request will be reviewed by the project maintainers. Be prepared to make additional changes based on their feedback. Engage in constructive discussions to refine your contribution.

## Merge Your Pull Request

Once your pull request is approved, it will be merged into the main repository. Congratulations on your contribution!

## Final words

If you need help or have questions, feel free to open an issue or discussion on GitHub.
