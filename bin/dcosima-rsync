# Cases to consider:
# A) Everything normal --> Wait until all expected sim files are there & nothing is running any more
# B) No free slot -- nothing got started yet --> Wait until all expected sim files are there & nothing is running any more
# C) Extremely short simulations -- running instances will always be 0 --> Wait until all expected sim files are there & nothing is running any more
# D) Long time before first events and thus sim file show up --> Wait until all expected sim files are there & nothing is running any more
# E) Faulty simulation -- nothing will ever get simulated --> dcosima should do a test sim...
# F) dcosima got aborted and we never get all sims --> dcosima must do a kill all, a last rsync, and a final clean
# G) More than one sim file per cosima run --> dcosima must set the correct number of sim files
