Version 2.29/2.30
=================

*** IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ:

+ El Capitan / Xcode 7.x users: Run the setup script with the additional option
  --patch=yes to apply a set of necessary patches to ROOT and Geant4
+ Exchanged the (slow) ROOT rotations (TMatrix*) in Geomega with new
  MRotation class
  --> If something seems wrong with your rotations email me
+ Partial rewrite of the MEGAlib file I/O classes to enable transparent 
  handling of gzip'ed files
  --> Since I had to modify the whole I/O chain (including the interfaces), 
      email me if there are any problems reading or writing files
+ First beta version of calibration framework Fretalon with Melinator line 
  calibrator
+ Exchange of the ROOT geometry backend (switch to the TGeo* classes)
  --> Since this switch required significant changes in Geomega, please verify
      your geometries
+ The MEGAlib default materials have been changed to the new format
  ("XYZ.ComponentByAtoms Si 1") which is based on natural isotope distributions
  in Geant4. Thus the cross sections changed slightly.
+ A compiler with C++11 support is now required - all current Mac and Linux
  compiler should do, e.g. g++ 4.8 and higher and Apple compiler 6.0
  and higher. 
+ ROOT is now built using cmake instead of its older, error prone configure
  script
 

*** KNOWN ISSUES
+ The performance of activation simulations is currently not the best...
  
  
*** Significant new features & improvements:

General:
+ Added automatic patch system to the build system
+ A compiler with C++11 support is now required - all current Mac and Linux
  compiler should do, e.g. g++ 4.8 and higher and Apple compiler 6.0
  and higher. The setup script will test for the compiler.
+ Capability to change font size for Retina displays
+ Capability to read and write gzip'ed files via zlib library
+ MTimer is now thread reentrant
+ Gnuzillion antique memory leaks fixed
+ New mvalgrind frontend for simplified memory issue debugging
+ ROOT is now built using cmake instead of its older, error prone configure
  script

Cosima:
+ Support for Geant4 10.0 (enables meta-stable states, but multi-threading 
  is not yet supported)
+ Support for Geant4 10.1 --- however, you have to add "101" manually to the 
  file config/AllowedGeant4Versions.txt since it has worse performance than 
  10.0
+ For improved activation simulations (and only those!) there are patches
  for Geant4 10.00.p04 and 10.01.p01 in resource/patches
+ New hadron physics list FTFP_BERT_HP
+ Restricted line source

+ Exchanged the (slow) ROOT rotations (TMatrix*) in Geomega with new MRotation 
  class
+ The MEGAlib default materials have been changed to the new format
  ("XYZ.ComponentByAtoms Si 1") which is based on natural isotope distributions
  in Geant4. Thus the cross sections changed slightly. You also get a warning now
  when you use the old format.
  
Reponse:
+ Improved binned Compton imaging response creation
  
Revan:
+ New multi-purpose spectral generator

Mimrec:

Realta:

Spectralizer:

*** Important bug fixes:
+ Various...




******************************************************************************


Version 2.27/2.28
=================

*** Important:
+ Compatibility with Geant4 9.6: Unit tests have revealed subtle differences
  They are not big enough to raise concerns, but just don't mix 9.5 & 9.6 sims
+ If you have detectors which only do vetoes, it is now required to set the
  "NoiseThresholdEqualsTriggerThreshold true" flag
+ If you do electron tracking it is now required to set the detectors in which 
  the electron tracking is performed
  
*** Significant new features & improvements:

General:
+ New MEGAlib icon!
+ Improved automated setup and more compiler options (e.g. clang support)
+ Coincidence window passthrough from revan to mimrec

  Significant (0..90%) speed up of load times, especially in hadronics case,
  and roughly 8% overall performance improvement
+ Compatibility with Geant 9.6
+ New unit test for cosima

Sivan:

Geomega:
+ Veto-only detectors require the flag "NoiseThresholdEqualsTriggerThreshold 
  true" to be set

Version 2.25/2.26
=================

*** Important:

THIS VERSION CONTAINS SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO ONE OF THE CORE COMPONENTS OF
MEGALIB. AS CONSEQUENCE, THIS VERSION IS MORE EXPERIMENTAL AS USUAL!

+ Test if your detector effect engine still works!
  For the introduction of named detectors a partial redesign of the detector
  effects engine was necessary.
+ Check if you still use the Compton reponse, which you want to use, in the 
  mimrec UI, since a new (actually an old) one was re-added.

  
*** Significant new features & improvements:

General:
+ New website: megalibtoolkit.com
+ New public repository: https://github.com/zoglauer/megalib
+ One step setup script for MEGAlib
+ Added installation scripts for ROOT, Geant4 (9.5 and higher), and HEAsoft.
  They can be found in the config directory, e.g. build-root.sh
+ Improved configuration script: "./configure" should be all you need to do
+ The change log and license are now displayed when one of the GUI tools.
  This adds a new configuration file called .megalib.cfg storing hashes
  of both files.

Cosima:
+ Compatibility with 9.5, dropped compatibility with 9.3
+ Updated hadronic physics-lists 

Sivan:

Geomega:
+ The preferred way to define components of materials is now via
  MyMaterial.ComponentBy[Atoms/Mass] Cs 1
  This way Geant4 can give the correct atomic mass and isotope composition 
  from its data bases.
  This definition is expected for activation simulations, where cross-sections
  per isotope are present
+ Named detectors: It is now possible to derive named detectors from normal
  detectors, which inhert all their properties except those explictly overwritten
  by the named detector. This allows to give detectors consisting of identical
  volumes different detector characteristics such as energy resolution

Revan:

Mimrec:
+ The response which caluclated the width of the Compton cones from uncertainties
  has been reintroduced. Check if you still use the Compton reponse, which you 
  want to use, in the mimrec UI

Realta:

Spectralizer:

Examples:
+ DetectorEffectEngine: Show all options of the detector effects engine and
  serves as unit test
+ Hadron therapy example
+ Graded Z-example

... plus many, many smaller things I already forgot about :)

+ If no depth resolution was present, the depth resolution in the calorimeters
  was ideal instead of centered in the voxel
  This bug was there a long time...



******************************************************************************



Version 2.21/2.22
=================

*** Important:

+ From now on uneven minor releases are development versions, even ones are 
  releases (similar to ROOT)
+ Mark Kippen dropped his G4LECS support, thus Geant4 9.2 is required
+ There was a problem when you have copies of scintillator detectors with 
  multiple sensitive volumes resulting in hits not always being put into the same
  detector. This resulted in a complex fix with several restrictions when you
  can use multiple sensitive volumes in one scintillator detector.
+ Mimrec has been partly rewritten - perform tests if everything still works
+ Partial Windows support means changes in many classes
+ Cosima now uses the trigger criteria from Geomega - check if your triggers
  are still OK

+ make update now (1) updates (2) reconfigures (3) compiles

Geomega:
+ Added new system object with the characteristic to noise the event time.
+ Under certain circumstances the IsDetector characteristics was wrong and 
  thus the volume sequence (but this always resulted in error messages)

+ Significant change in the interfaces to allow processing in external pipeline


*** Important bug fixes:

+ There was a problem when you have copies of scintillator detectors with 
  multiple sensitive volumes resulting in hits not always being put into the same
  detector. This resulted in a complex fix with several restrictions when you
  can use multiple sensitive volumes in one scintillator detector
+ TI was not correctly read in if format differed from MEGAlib sim format
+ Cosima: DECA was in nanosec instead of sec 
+ Previoulsy, if you had galactic coordinates then the rotation is also 
  applied in spherical and Certesian coordinates, now it is distinguished
  between detector rotation and galactic pointing - you can have both
+ The polarization angle reported in Mimrec's polarization analysis was off 
  by 90-(pi/2) degrees...


******************************************************************************


Version 2.20
============

*** Important:

+ Known bug (fixed only in 2.21):
  If you have galactic coordinates then the rotation is also applied in 
  spherical coordinates
+ Backport fix:
  There was a problem when you have copies of scintillator detectors with 
  multiple sensitive volumes resulting in hits not always being put into the same
  detector. This resulted in a complex fix with several restrictions when you
  can use multiple sensitive volumes in one scintillator detector.
+ Due to problems with case-invariance of MacOSX only "cosima" is availble 
  and no longer "Cosima" to start Cosima
+ The energy resolution interface bhas been updated. Verify is your spectra 
  are still identical.


*** New features & improvements:

Geomega:
+ Append lines with "\\" keyword as last keyword
+ If-clauses

+ Configuration problems on Mac OSX
+ In Function2D was a copy paste error always using the x axis and not the 
  y-axis, which lead to a wrong symmetry assumption
+ There was a problem when you have copies of scintillator detectors with 
  multiple sensitive volumes resulting in hits not always being put into the same
  detector. This resulted in a complex fix with several restrictions when you
  can use multiple sensitive volumes in one scintillator detector
+ TI was not read in correctly if format differed from sim format


******************************************************************************


Version 2.19
============

*** Important:

+ If you update from a previous version, you need to reconfigure MEGAlib!
+ This version integrates many of the response related changes intended for 
  3.0 into the 2.x branch. Thus test this version thoroughly.
+ The sim event storing routines have been rewritten. If there are problems
  reading older files, let me know.
+ The IA & SimEvent interfaces have been renamed. The old ones are still 
  available but should give a depreciated warning. Please update your 
  interfaces!
+ Partial rewrite of MFile & MFileEvents classes and all files based on it.
  This is another big change thus check if all files can be opened correctly.
+ In Cosima replaced the keywords SpectralType, Energy, Position with the 
  keyword based Spectrum and Energy, i.e. you now don't give numbers such as 
  "1 1" any mode but say FarFieldPointSource!
+ Don't use the Penelope code for Compton detector event reconstruction 
  responses and always turn of fluorescence, since the code is not ready to 
  handle more than one generated particle during Compton scattering


*** New features & improvements:

General:
+ SensitivityOptimizer capable of calculating sensitivity per steradian
+ Partial rewrite of MFile & MFileEvents 
+ MParser, MTokenizer interface remodelling

Response:

+ Replaced the keywords SpectralType, Energy, Position with the keyword based 
  Spectrum and Energy, i.e. you now don't give numbers such as "1 1" any mode 
  but say FarFieldPointSource
+ New examples
+ More input sanity checks
+ Spectums loaded by file now allow for lin-lin, lin-log, log-lin, log-log 
  interpolation

Sivan:
+ The sim event storing routines have been rewritten (only latest sim format 
  is written, new write routines allowing scientific notation. If there are 
  problems reading older files, let me know.
+ The IA & SimEvent interfaces have been renamed. The old ones are still 
  available but should give a depreciated warning. Please update your 
  interfaces
+ Eliminated ECs (are IAs since a long time now)
+ New option: Show secondary generation pattern (=locations)

Revan:
+ New option: Show spatial energy distribution (not only hit distribution)

Mimrec:
+ OS-EM is available again


*** Bug fixes:

Revan:
+ The TI was not always read in correctly leading to jumps in the time sequence
+ The NF keyword was not honoured

Mimrec:
+ The excluded detectors were not read in correctly in the new Xml format

Cosima:
+ The x-y-axes of the ProfiledBeam/MapProfileBeam beam were not scaled to cm, 
  thus the beam was a factor of 10 too narrow

General:
+ Increased stability of multi-threading

Many minor ones, segfaults and other crashes




******************************************************************************



Version 2.18
============

*** Important:

+ If you update from a previous version, you need to reconfigure MEGAlib!
+ Due to a switch to XML in the configuration files, you have to check if they
  are still consistent 
+ In old configuration files the standard maximum amount for RAM for the 
  response slices ("back projections") was 1 GB. You should check if you do not
  want a larger value (mimrec -> imaging -> memory management)!
+ The new automatic calculation of cross section files invalidates all old 
  cross section files since they do not have a hash value linked to the 
  materials


*** New features & improvements:

General:
+ Integrated Cosima into MEGAlib
+ Improved configuration script
+ Mimrec/Revan/Sivan/Geomega configuration files are now XML based

Geomega:
+ Added Geant4 based overlap search
